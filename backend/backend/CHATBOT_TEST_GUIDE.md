# üß™ Chatbot Integration Test Results

## ‚úÖ Integration Status: SUCCESSFUL

Your chatbot has been successfully integrated into your FastAPI backend! Here's what was tested and verified:

### ‚úÖ What's Working:

1. **Chatbot Module Import** - All chatbot functions import correctly
2. **API Schemas** - ChatQuery and ChatResponse schemas are properly defined
3. **Router Configuration** - Chatbot router is correctly configured with `/chat/` endpoint
4. **AQI Data Fetching** - Successfully fetches real-time air quality data from AirNow API
5. **AI Response Generation** - Groq AI generates contextual responses based on AQI data
6. **Schema Validation** - Request/response validation works correctly

### üöÄ How to Test Your Chatbot API

#### Method 1: Using curl (Command Line)
```bash
# Start your server (in backend directory)
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Test the chatbot endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What is the air quality like today?",
    "zip_code": "94103",
    "health_issue": "asthma",
    "activity": "jogging"
  }'
```

#### Method 2: Using Python requests
```python
import requests

# Test data
payload = {
    "question": "How is the air quality?",
    "zip_code": "10001",  # New York
    "health_issue": "asthma"
}

# Make request
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/chat/",
    json=payload,
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
)

print(response.json())
```

#### Method 3: Using FastAPI Docs (Interactive)
1. Start your server: `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000`
2. Open browser: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
3. Find the `/chat/` endpoint
4. Click "Try it out"
5. Enter your test data and click "Execute"

### üìã Sample Test Cases

#### Basic Question
```json
{
  "question": "What's the air quality like today?"
}
```

#### With Location
```json
{
  "question": "How is the air quality in New York?",
  "zip_code": "10001"
}
```

#### With Health Context
```json
{
  "question": "Is it safe to exercise outside?",
  "zip_code": "94103",
  "health_issue": "asthma",
  "activity": "running"
}
```

### üîß Expected Response Format
```json
{
  "answer": "The air quality in San Francisco (94103) is moderate...",
  "active_zip": "94103"
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Database Connection**: Your main server requires PostgreSQL. For testing without database:
   - Use the test server: `python test_server.py`
   - Or modify main.py to skip database initialization

2. **API Keys**: Make sure your environment variables are set:
   - `AIRNOW_API_KEY` (for air quality data)
   - `GROQ_API_KEY` (for AI responses)

3. **CORS**: Your server is configured to accept requests from:
   - `http://localhost:3000`
   - `http://localhost:5173`
   - `http://localhost:8080`

### üéØ Next Steps for Frontend Integration

1. **Start your backend server**
2. **Test the `/chat/` endpoint** using one of the methods above
3. **Integrate with your frontend** by making POST requests to `http://localhost:8000/chat/`
4. **Handle the response** which includes both the AI answer and the ZIP code used

Your chatbot integration is complete and ready for frontend use! üöÄ
